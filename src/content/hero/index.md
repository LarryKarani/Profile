As a software engineer, I specialize in building scalable and maintainable web applications using a powerful combination of React, TypeScript, Javascript, Headless CMS and GraphQl. With my expertise in these technologies, I am able to create dynamic and engaging user experiences that meet the needs of modern web applications.
